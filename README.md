A Tool for doing O3 overlays. There might be a lot of bugs still but it kind of works. It's still a work in progress though.

Run OverlayTool.py to launch the GUI. For transparent backgrounds FFMPEG needs to be installed and available in the console.

Creation of .osd files only works with the DJI goggles V2. The mod is at "Goggles_MOD/libs/armeabi-v7a/libO3_OSD_recording.so" or you can build it again using built.bat. Installation on the googles works after rooting using the WTF.os hack (https://fpv.wtf) and installing the mod via the modloader https://github.com/fpv-wtf/wtfos-modloader. Currently only works after downgrading the modloader to 0.2.1.
